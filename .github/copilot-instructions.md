# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Code Style

- **Avoid unnecessary comments** - Write readable code instead
- **Comment only complex logic** - When the "why" isn't obvious
- **Use descriptive names** - Make code self-documenting

### Examples

```gdscript
# Bad
var health = 100  # Player health

# Good
var player_health_points = 100
```

## Project Context

- **Framework**: Godot 4.x, GDScript
- **Style**: snake_case variables, PascalCase classes
